# Modernize your legacy code with GitHub Copilot

<img src="https://octodex.github.com/images/Professortocat_v2.png" align="right" height="200px" />

> **Note:** This is an adaptation of the [original GitHub Skills lesson](https://github.com/skills/modernize-your-legacy-code-with-github-copilot) that has been modified to demonstrate [SpecOps](https://spec-ops.ai) principles. SpecOps is a methodology for using AI to modernize legacy systems by focusing on **knowledge preservation and verified specifications** rather than direct code translation. In this adapted lesson, you'll learn to create a comprehensive software specification from legacy COBOL code before generating a modern Node.js implementation.

## SpecOps Toolkit

This repository includes standard SpecOps components that you can reuse in your own projects:

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) | Instructions for AI agents working on this codebase. Encodes the SpecOps methodology—specification-driven development where the spec is the source of truth. Configure this file to guide AI assistants in your own projects. |
| [.github/workflows/spec-change-issues.yml](.github/workflows/spec-change-issues.yml) | GitHub Actions workflow using the [SpecOps Action](https://github.com/spec-ops-method/spec-ops-action) to automatically create issues when specification files are modified. This ensures spec changes generate trackable work items for implementation review. |

Hey mheadd!

Mona here. I'm done preparing your exercise. Hope you enjoy! 💚

Remember, it's self-paced so feel free to take a break! ☕️
